rot

Apply rotational 13 cypher to hide text.

Note: this cypher is not suitable for encryption. It can be useful to prevent
accidental reading of the encrypted content â€“ e.g., to hide spoilers on social
media in such a way that people can read it if they want, but have to take an
explicit step to do so.
